That will also ensure all data has been flushed, which the\n/// `into_inner()` function does *not* do.\n///\n/// Calling this method after `finish()` has completed successfully will panic, since the\n/// writer has already been returned.\n///\n/// This method may be useful if the writer implements additional APIs beyond the `Write`\n/// trait. Note that the inner writer might be in an error state or have an incomplete\n/// base64 string written to it.\n",
