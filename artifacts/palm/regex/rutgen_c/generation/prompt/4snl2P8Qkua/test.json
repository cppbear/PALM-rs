  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",

If the AST exceeds the given limit (e.g., with too many nested\n/// groups), then an error is returned by the parser.\n///\n/// The purpose of this limit is to act as a heuristic to prevent stack\n/// overflow for consumers that do structural induction on an `Ast` using\n/// explicit recursion. While this crate never does this (instead using\n/// constant stack space and moving the call stack to the heap), other\n/// crates may.\n///\n/// This limit is not checked until the entire Ast is parsed. Therefore,\n/// if callers want to put a limit on the amount of heap space used, then\n/// they should impose a limit on the length, in bytes, of the concrete\n/// pattern string. In particular, this is viable since this parser\n/// implementation will limit itself to heap space proportional to the\n/// lenth of the pattern string.\n///\n/// Note that a nest limit of `0` will return a nest limit error for most\n/// patterns but not all. For example, a nest limit of `0` permits `a` but\n/// not `ab`, since `ab` requires a concatenation, which results in a nest\n/// depth of `1`. In general, a nest limit is not something that manifests\n/// in an obvious way in the concrete syntax, therefore, it should not be\n/// used in a granular way.\npub fn nest_limit(&mut self, limit: u32) -> &mut ParserBuilder {\n    self.nest_limit = limit;\n    self\n}\n",
