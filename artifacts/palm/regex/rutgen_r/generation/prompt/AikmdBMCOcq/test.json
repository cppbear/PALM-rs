  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",
  "static_pt": "// src/re_bytes.rs\n// crate name is regex\nThe function to be tested is presented as follows:\n/// Returns an iterator of at most `limit` substrings of `text` delimited\n/// by a match of the regular expression. (A `limit` of `0` will return no\n/// substrings.) Namely, each element of the iterator corresponds to text\n/// that *isn't* matched by the regular expression. The remainder of the\n/// string that is not split will be the last element in the iterator.\n///\n/// This method will *not* copy the text given.\n///\n/// # Example\n///\n/// Get the first two words in some text:\n///\n/// ```rust\n/// # extern crate regex; use regex::bytes::Regex;\n/// # fn main() {\n/// let re = Regex::new(r\"\\W+\").unwrap();\n/// let fields: Vec<&[u8]> = re.splitn(b\"Hey! How are you?\", 3).collect();\n/// assert_eq!(fields, vec![&b\"Hey\"[..], &b\"How\"[..], &b\"are you?\"[..]]);\n/// # }\n/// ```\npub fn splitn<'r, 't>(\n    &'r self,\n    text: &'t [u8],\n    limit: usize,\n) -> SplitN<'r, 't> {\n    SplitN {\n        splits: self.split(text),\n        n: limit,\n    }\n}\nGiven the following constraints, potential panic-triggering statements, and expected return values/types (all extracted from the function under test).\nGenerate test inputs that maximize the function's runtime satisfaction of all constraints and expected outputs while considering panic conditions:\n",
