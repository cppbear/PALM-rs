  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",

Otherwise, the parser is\n/// advanced to the first byte following the closing `]` and the\n/// corresponding ASCII class is returned.\nfn maybe_parse_ascii_class(&self) -> Option<ast::ClassAscii> {\n    // ASCII character classes are interesting from a parsing perspective\n    // because parsing cannot fail with any interesting error. For example,\n    // in order to use an ASCII character class, it must be enclosed in\n    // double brackets, e.g., `[[:alnum:]]`. Alternatively, you might think\n    // of it as \"ASCII character characters have the syntax `[:NAME:]`\n    // which can only appear within character brackets.\" This means that\n    // things like `[[:lower:]A]` are legal constructs.\n    //\n    // However, if one types an incorrect ASCII character class, e.g.,\n    // `[[:loower:]]`, then we treat that as a normal nested character\n    // class containing the characters `:elorw`. One might argue that we\n    // should return an error instead since the repeated colons give away\n    // the intent to write an ASCII class. But what if the user typed\n    // `[[:lower]]` instead?
