  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",
  "static_pt": "// regex-syntax/src/hir/visitor.rs\n// crate name is regex_syntax\nThe function to be tested is presented as follows:\n/// Executes an implementation of `Visitor` in constant stack space.\n///\n/// This function will visit every node in the given `Hir` while calling\n/// appropriate methods provided by the\n/// [`Visitor`](trait.Visitor.html) trait.\n///\n/// The primary use case for this method is when one wants to perform case\n/// analysis over an `Hir` without using a stack size proportional to the depth\n/// of the `Hir`. Namely, this method will instead use constant stack space,\n/// but will use heap space proportional to the size of the `Hir`. This may be\n/// desirable in cases where the size of `Hir` is proportional to end user\n/// input.\n///\n/// If the visitor returns an error at any point, then visiting is stopped and\n/// the error is returned.\npub fn visit<V: Visitor>(hir: &Hir, visitor: V) -> Result<V::Output, V::Err> {\n    HeapVisitor::new().visit(hir, visitor)\n}\n",
