  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",

It turns out a handrolled\n/// platform-specific memchr routine with a bit of frequency\n/// analysis sprinkled on top actually wins most of the time.\n/// However, there are a few cases where Tuned Boyer-Moore still\n/// wins.\n///\n/// If the haystack is random, frequency analysis doesn't help us,\n/// so Boyer-Moore will win for sufficiently large needles.\n/// Unfortunately, there is no obvious way to determine this\n/// ahead of time.\n///\n/// If the pattern itself consists of very common characters,\n/// frequency analysis won't get us anywhere. The most extreme\n/// example of this is a pattern like `eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee`. Fortunately,\n/// this case is wholly determined by the pattern, so we can actually\n/// implement the heuristic.\n///\n/// A third case is if the pattern is sufficiently long. The idea\n/// here is that once the pattern gets long enough the Tuned\n/// Boyer-Moore skip loop will start making strides long enough\n/// to beat the asm deep magic that is memchr.\nfn should_use(pattern: &[u8]) -> bool {\n    // The minimum pattern length required to use TBM.\n    const MIN_LEN: usize = 9;\n    // The minimum frequency rank (lower is rarer) that every byte in the\n    // pattern must have in order to use TBM.
