  "doc": "/// Whether to support octal syntax or not.\n///\n/// Octal syntax is a little-known way of uttering Unicode codepoints in\n/// a regular expression. For example, `a`, `\\x61`, `\\u0061` and\n/// `\\141` are all equivalent regular expressions, where the last example\n/// shows octal syntax.\n///\n/// While supporting octal syntax isn't in and of itself a problem, it does\n/// make good error messages harder. That is, in PCRE based regex engines,\n/// syntax like `\\0` invokes a backreference, which is explicitly\n/// unsupported in Rust's regex engine. However, many users expect it to\n/// be supported. Therefore, when octal support is disabled, the error\n/// message will explicitly mention that backreferences aren't supported.\n///\n/// Octal syntax is disabled by default.\n",
