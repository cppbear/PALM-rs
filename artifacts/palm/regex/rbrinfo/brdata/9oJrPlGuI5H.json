  "doc": "/// The key heuristic behind which the BoyerMooreSearch lives.\n///\n/// See `rust-lang/regex/issues/408`.\n///\n/// Tuned Boyer-Moore is actually pretty slow! It turns out a handrolled\n/// platform-specific memchr routine with a bit of frequency\n/// analysis sprinkled on top actually wins most of the time.\n/// However, there are a few cases where Tuned Boyer-Moore still\n/// wins.\n///\n/// If the haystack is random, frequency analysis doesn't help us,\n/// so Boyer-Moore will win for sufficiently large needles.\n/// Unfortunately, there is no obvious way to determine this\n/// ahead of time.\n///\n/// If the pattern itself consists of very common characters,\n/// frequency analysis won't get us anywhere. The most extreme\n/// example of this is a pattern like `eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee`. Fortunately,\n/// this case is wholly determined by the pattern, so we can actually\n/// implement the heuristic.\n///\n/// A third case is if the pattern is sufficiently long. The idea\n/// here is that once the pattern gets long enough the Tuned\n/// Boyer-Moore skip loop will start making strides long enough\n/// to beat the asm deep magic that is memchr.\n",
