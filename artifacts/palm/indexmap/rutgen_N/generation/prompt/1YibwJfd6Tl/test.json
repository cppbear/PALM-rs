  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",
  "static_pt": "// src/set.rs\n// crate name is indexmap\nThe function to be tested is presented as follows:\n/// Creates a splicing iterator that replaces the specified range in the set\n/// with the given `replace_with` iterator and yields the removed items.\n/// `replace_with` does not need to be the same length as `range`.\n///\n/// The `range` is removed even if the iterator is not consumed until the\n/// end. It is unspecified how many elements are removed from the set if the\n/// `Splice` value is leaked.\n///\n/// The input iterator `replace_with` is only consumed when the `Splice`\n/// value is dropped. If a value from the iterator matches an existing entry\n/// in the set (outside of `range`), then the original will be unchanged.\n/// Otherwise, the new value will be inserted in the replaced `range`.\n///\n/// ***Panics*** if the starting point is greater than the end point or if\n/// the end point is greater than the length of the set.\n///\n/// # Examples\n///\n/// ```\n/// use indexmap::IndexSet;\n///\n/// let mut set = IndexSet::from([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]);\n/// let new = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1];\n/// let removed: Vec<_> = set.splice(2..4, new).collect();\n///\n/// // 1 and 4 kept their positions, while 5, 3, and 2 were newly inserted.\n/// assert!(set.into_iter().eq([0, 1, 5, 3, 2, 4]));\n/// assert_eq!(removed, &[2, 3]);\n/// ```\npub fn splice<R, I>(&mut self, range: R, replace_with: I) -> Splice<'_, I::IntoIter, T, S>\nwhere\n    R: RangeBounds<usize>,\n    I: IntoIterator<Item = T>,\n{\n    Splice::new(self, range, replace_with.into_iter())\n}\n",
