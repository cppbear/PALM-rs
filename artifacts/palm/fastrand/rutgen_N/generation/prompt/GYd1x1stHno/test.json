  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",
  "static_pt": "// src/lib.rs\n// crate name is fastrand\nThe function to be tested is presented as follows:\n/// Clones the generator by deterministically deriving a new generator based on the initial\n/// seed.\n///\n/// This function can be used to create a new generator that is a \"spinoff\" of the old\n/// generator. The new generator will not produce the same sequence of values as the\n/// old generator.\n///\n/// # Example\n///\n/// ```\n/// // Seed two generators equally, and clone both of them.\n/// let mut base1 = fastrand::Rng::with_seed(0x4d595df4d0f33173);\n/// base1.bool(); // Use the generator once.\n///\n/// let mut base2 = fastrand::Rng::with_seed(0x4d595df4d0f33173);\n/// base2.bool(); // Use the generator once.\n///\n/// let mut rng1 = base1.fork();\n/// let mut rng2 = base2.fork();\n///\n/// println!(\"rng1 returns {}\", rng1.u32(..));\n/// println!(\"rng2 returns {}\", rng2.u32(..));\n/// ```\npub fn fork(&mut self) -> Self {\n    Rng::with_seed(self.gen_u64())\n}\n",
