  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",
  "static_pt": "// src/raw/mod.rs\n// crate name is hashbrown\nThe function to be tested is presented as follows:\n/// Searches for an empty or deleted bucket which is suitable for inserting a new\n/// element and sets the hash for that slot. Returns an index of that slot and the\n/// old control byte stored in the found index.\n///\n/// This function does not check if the given element exists in the table. Also,\n/// this function does not check if there is enough space in the table to insert\n/// a new element. The caller of the function must make sure that the table has at\n/// least 1 empty or deleted `bucket`, otherwise this function will never return\n/// (will go into an infinite loop) for tables larger than the group width, or\n/// return an index outside of the table indices range if the table is less than\n/// the group width.\n///\n/// If there is at least 1 empty or deleted `bucket` in the table, the function is\n/// guaranteed to return an `index` in the range `0..self.buckets()`, but in any case,\n/// if this function returns an `index` it will be in the range `0..=self.buckets()`.\n///\n/// This function does not make any changes to the `data` parts of the table,\n/// or any changes to the `items` or `growth_left` field of the table.\n///\n/// # Safety\n///\n/// The safety rules are directly derived from the safety rules for the\n/// [`RawTableInner::set_ctrl_hash`] and [`RawTableInner::find_insert_slot`] methods.\n/// Thus, in order to uphold the safety contracts for that methods, as well as for\n/// the correct logic of the work of this crate, you must observe the following rules\n/// when calling this function:\n///\n/// * The [`RawTableInner`] has already been allocated and has properly initialized\n///   control bytes otherwise calling this function results in [`undefined behavior`].\n///\n/// * The caller of this function must ensure that the \"data\" parts of the table\n///   will have an entry in the returned index (matching the given hash) right\n///   after calling this function.\n///\n/// Attempt to write data at the `index` returned by this function when the table is\n/// less than the group width and if there was not at least one empty or deleted bucket in\n/// the table will cause immediate [`undefined behavior`]. This is because in this case the\n/// function will return `self.bucket_mask + 1` as an index due to the trailing [`Tag::EMPTY`]\n/// control bytes outside the table range.\n///\n/// The caller must independently increase the `items` field of the table, and also,\n/// if the old control byte was [`Tag::EMPTY`], then decrease the table's `growth_left`\n/// field, and do not change it if the old control byte was [`Tag::DELETED`].\n///\n/// See also [`Bucket::as_ptr`] method, for more information about of properly removing\n/// or saving `element` from / into the [`RawTable`] / [`RawTableInner`].\n///\n/// [`Bucket::as_ptr`]: Bucket::as_ptr\n/// [`undefined behavior`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html\n/// [`RawTableInner::ctrl`]: RawTableInner::ctrl\n/// [`RawTableInner::set_ctrl_hash`]: RawTableInner::set_ctrl_hash\n/// [`RawTableInner::find_insert_slot`]: RawTableInner::find_insert_slot\nunsafe fn prepare_insert_slot(&mut self, hash: u64) -> (usize, Tag) {\n    // SAFETY: Caller of this function ensures that the control bytes are properly initialized.\n    let index: usize = self.find_insert_slot(hash).index;\n    // SAFETY:\n    // 1. The `find_insert_slot` function either returns an `index` less than or\n    //    equal to `self.buckets() = self.bucket_mask + 1` of the table, or never\n    //    returns if it cannot find an empty or deleted slot.\n    // 2. The caller of this function guarantees that the table has already been\n    //    allocated\n    let old_ctrl = *self.ctrl(index);\n    self.set_ctrl_hash(index, hash);\n    (index, old_ctrl)\n}\n",
