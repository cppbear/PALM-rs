  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",
  "static_pt": "// src/raw/mod.rs\n// crate name is hashbrown\nThe function to be tested is presented as follows:\n/// Folds every element into an accumulator by applying an operation,\n/// returning the final result.\n///\n/// `fold_impl()` takes three arguments: the number of items remaining in\n/// the iterator, an initial value, and a closure with two arguments: an\n/// 'accumulator', and an element. The closure returns the value that the\n/// accumulator should have for the next iteration.\n///\n/// The initial value is the value the accumulator will have on the first call.\n///\n/// After applying this closure to every element of the iterator, `fold_impl()`\n/// returns the accumulator.\n///\n/// # Safety\n///\n/// If any of the following conditions are violated, the result is\n/// [`Undefined Behavior`]:\n///\n/// * The [`RawTableInner`] / [`RawTable`] must be alive and not moved,\n///   i.e. table outlives the `RawIterRange`;\n///\n/// * The provided `n` value must match the actual number of items\n///   in the table.\n///\n/// [`Undefined Behavior`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html\nunsafe fn fold_impl<F, B>(mut self, mut n: usize, mut acc: B, mut f: F) -> B\nwhere\n    F: FnMut(B, Bucket<T>) -> B,\n{\n    loop {\n        while let Some(index) = self.current_group.next() {\n            // The returned `index` will always be in the range `0..Group::WIDTH`,\n            // so that calling `self.data.next_n(index)` is safe (see detailed explanation below).\n            debug_assert!(n != 0);\n            let bucket = self.data.next_n(index);\n            acc = f(acc, bucket);\n            n -= 1;\n        }\n\n        if n == 0 {\n            return acc;\n        }\n\n        // SAFETY: The caller of this function ensures that:\n        //\n        // 1.
