  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",
  "static_pt": "// src/raw/mod.rs\n// crate name is hashbrown\nThe function to be tested is presented as follows:\n/// Searches for an empty or deleted bucket which is suitable for inserting\n/// a new element, returning the `index` for the new [`Bucket`].\n///\n/// This function does not make any changes to the `data` part of the table, or any\n/// changes to the `items` or `growth_left` field of the table.\n///\n/// The table must have at least 1 empty or deleted `bucket`, otherwise this function\n/// will never return (will go into an infinite loop) for tables larger than the group\n/// width, or return an index outside of the table indices range if the table is less\n/// than the group width.\n///\n/// If there is at least 1 empty or deleted `bucket` in the table, the function is\n/// guaranteed to return [`InsertSlot`] with an index in the range `0..self.buckets()`,\n/// but in any case, if this function returns [`InsertSlot`], it will contain an index\n/// in the range `0..=self.buckets()`.\n///\n/// # Safety\n///\n/// The [`RawTableInner`] must have properly initialized control bytes otherwise calling\n/// this function results in [`undefined behavior`].\n///\n/// Attempt to write data at the [`InsertSlot`] returned by this function when the table is\n/// less than the group width and if there was not at least one empty or deleted bucket in\n/// the table will cause immediate [`undefined behavior`].
