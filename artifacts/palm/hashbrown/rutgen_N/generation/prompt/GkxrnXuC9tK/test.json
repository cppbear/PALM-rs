  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",
  "static_pt": "// src/map.rs\n// crate name is hashbrown\nThe function to be tested is presented as follows:\n/// Insert a key-value pair into the map without checking\n/// if the key already exists in the map.\n///\n/// This operation is faster than regular insert, because it does not perform\n/// lookup before insertion.\n///\n/// This operation is useful during initial population of the map.\n/// For example, when constructing a map from another map, we know\n/// that keys are unique.\n///\n/// Returns a reference to the key and value just inserted.\n///\n/// # Safety\n///\n/// This operation is safe if a key does not exist in the map.\n///\n/// However, if a key exists in the map already, the behavior is unspecified:\n/// this operation may panic, loop forever, or any following operation with the map\n/// may panic, loop forever or return arbitrary result.\n///\n/// That said, this operation (and following operations) are guaranteed to\n/// not violate memory safety.\n///\n/// However this operation is still unsafe because the resulting `HashMap`\n/// may be passed to unsafe code which does expect the map to behave\n/// correctly, and would cause unsoundness as a result.\n///\n/// # Examples\n///\n/// ```\n/// use hashbrown::HashMap;\n///\n/// let mut map1 = HashMap::new();\n/// assert_eq!(map1.insert(1, \"a\"), None);\n/// assert_eq!(map1.insert(2, \"b\"), None);\n/// assert_eq!(map1.insert(3, \"c\"), None);\n/// assert_eq!(map1.len(), 3);\n///\n/// let mut map2 = HashMap::new();\n///\n/// for (key, value) in map1.into_iter() {\n///     unsafe {\n///         map2.insert_unique_unchecked(key, value);\n///     }\n/// }\n///\n/// let (key, value) = unsafe { map2.insert_unique_unchecked(4, \"d\") };\n/// assert_eq!(key, &4);\n/// assert_eq!(value, &mut \"d\");\n/// *value = \"e\";\n///\n/// assert_eq!(map2[&1], \"a\");\n/// assert_eq!(map2[&2], \"b\");\n/// assert_eq!(map2[&3], \"c\");\n/// assert_eq!(map2[&4], \"e\");\n/// assert_eq!(map2.len(), 4);\n/// ```\npub unsafe fn insert_unique_unchecked(&mut self, k: K, v: V) -> (&K, &mut V) {\n    let hash = make_hash::<K, S>(&self.hash_builder, &k);\n    let bucket = self\n        .table\n        .insert(hash, (k, v), make_hasher::<_, V, S>(&self.hash_builder));\n    let (k_ref, v_ref) = unsafe { bucket.as_mut() };\n    (k_ref, v_ref)\n}\n",
