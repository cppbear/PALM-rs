  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",
  "static_pt": "// src/raw/mod.rs\n// crate name is hashbrown\nThe function to be tested is presented as follows:\n/// Fixes up an insertion slot returned by the [`RawTableInner::find_insert_slot_in_group`] method.\n///\n/// In tables smaller than the group width (`self.buckets() < Group::WIDTH`), trailing control\n/// bytes outside the range of the table are filled with [`Tag::EMPTY`] entries. These will unfortunately\n/// trigger a match of [`RawTableInner::find_insert_slot_in_group`] function. This is because\n/// the `Some(bit)` returned by `group.match_empty_or_deleted().lowest_set_bit()` after masking\n/// (`(probe_seq.pos + bit) & self.bucket_mask`) may point to a full bucket that is already occupied.\n/// We detect this situation here and perform a second scan starting at the beginning of the table.\n/// This second scan is guaranteed to find an empty slot (due to the load factor) before hitting the\n/// trailing control bytes (containing [`Tag::EMPTY`] bytes).\n///\n/// If this function is called correctly, it is guaranteed to return [`InsertSlot`] with an\n/// index of an empty or deleted bucket in the range `0..self.buckets()` (see `Warning` and\n/// `Safety`).\n///\n/// # Warning\n///\n/// The table must have at least 1 empty or deleted `bucket`, otherwise if the table is less than\n/// the group width (`self.buckets() < Group::WIDTH`) this function returns an index outside of the\n/// table indices range `0..self.buckets()` (`0..=self.bucket_mask`). Attempt to write data at that\n/// index will cause immediate [`undefined behavior`].\n///\n/// # Safety\n///\n/// The safety rules are directly derived from the safety rules for [`RawTableInner::ctrl`] method.\n/// Thus, in order to uphold those safety contracts, as well as for the correct logic of the work\n/// of this crate, the following rules are necessary and sufficient:\n///\n/// * The [`RawTableInner`] must have properly initialized control bytes otherwise calling this\n///   function results in [`undefined behavior`].\n///\n/// * This function must only be used on insertion slots found by [`RawTableInner::find_insert_slot_in_group`]\n///   (after the `find_insert_slot_in_group` function, but before insertion into the table).\n///\n/// * The `index` must not be greater than the `self.bucket_mask`, i.e. `(index + 1) <= self.buckets()`\n///   (this one is provided by the [`RawTableInner::find_insert_slot_in_group`] function).\n///\n/// Calling this function with an index not provided by [`RawTableInner::find_insert_slot_in_group`]\n/// may result in [`undefined behavior`] even if the index satisfies the safety rules of the\n/// [`RawTableInner::ctrl`] function (`index < self.bucket_mask + 1 + Group::WIDTH`).\n///\n/// [`RawTableInner::ctrl`]: RawTableInner::ctrl\n/// [`RawTableInner::find_insert_slot_in_group`]: RawTableInner::find_insert_slot_in_group\n/// [`undefined behavior`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html\nunsafe fn fix_insert_slot(&self, mut index: usize) -> InsertSlot {\n    // SAFETY: The caller of this function ensures that `index` is in the range `0..=self.bucket_mask`.\n    if unlikely(self.is_bucket_full(index)) {\n        debug_assert!(self.bucket_mask < Group::WIDTH);\n        // SAFETY:\n        //\n        // * Since the caller of this function ensures that the control bytes are properly\n        //   initialized and `ptr = self.ctrl(0)` points to the start of the array of control\n        //   bytes, therefore: `ctrl` is valid for reads, properly aligned to `Group::WIDTH`\n        //   and points to the properly initialized control bytes (see also\n        //   `TableLayout::calculate_layout_for` and `ptr::read`);\n        //\n        // * Because the caller of this function ensures that the index was provided by the\n        //   `self.find_insert_slot_in_group()` function, so for for tables larger than the\n        //   group width (self.buckets() >= Group::WIDTH), we will never end up in the given\n        //   branch, since `(probe_seq.pos + bit) & self.bucket_mask` in `find_insert_slot_in_group`\n        //   cannot return a full bucket index. For tables smaller than the group width, calling\n        //   the `unwrap_unchecked` function is also safe, as the trailing control bytes outside\n        //   the range of the table are filled with EMPTY bytes (and we know for sure that there\n        //   is at least one FULL bucket), so this second scan either finds an empty slot (due to\n        //   the load factor) or hits the trailing control bytes (containing EMPTY).\n        index = Group::load_aligned(self.ctrl(0))\n            .match_empty_or_deleted()\n            .lowest_set_bit()\n            .unwrap_unchecked();\n    }\n    InsertSlot { index }\n}\nGiven the following constraints, potential panic-triggering statements, and expected return values/types (all extracted from the function under test).\nGenerate test inputs that maximize the function's runtime satisfaction of all constraints and expected outputs while considering panic conditions:\n",
