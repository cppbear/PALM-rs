  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",
  "static_pt": "// src/bytes.rs\n// crate name is bytes\nThe function to be tested is presented as follows:\n/// Returns true if this is the only reference to the data and\n/// `Into<BytesMut>` would avoid cloning the underlying buffer.\n///\n/// Always returns false if the data is backed by a [static slice](Bytes::from_static),\n/// or an [owner](Bytes::from_owner).\n///\n/// The result of this method may be invalidated immediately if another\n/// thread clones this value while this is being called. Ensure you have\n/// unique access to this value (`&mut Bytes`) first if you need to be\n/// certain the result is valid (i.e. for safety reasons).\n/// # Examples\n///\n/// ```\n/// use bytes::Bytes;\n///\n/// let a = Bytes::from(vec![1, 2, 3]);\n/// assert!(a.is_unique());\n/// let b = a.clone();\n/// assert!(!a.is_unique());\n/// ```\npub fn is_unique(&self) -> bool {\n    unsafe { (self.vtable.is_unique)(&self.data) }\n}\n",
