Generate executable test oracle codes in plain text format, one per line. Do not output complete test functions, do not repeat provided test prefixes, avoid additional explanations, and do not use Markdown.\n2. Generate necessary test oracles solely for the provided test prefixes.\n3. Each test oracle's assertions are independent and have no dependencies between them.\n4. Group all non-assertion statements first, followed by all assertion statements.\n5. Generate test oracles by interpreting the behavior of the test function through the provided test prefixes, context, and documentation.\n",
