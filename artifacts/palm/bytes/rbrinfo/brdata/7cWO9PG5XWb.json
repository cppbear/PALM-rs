  "doc": "/// Reserves capacity for at least `additional` more bytes to be inserted\n/// into the given `BytesMut`.\n///\n/// More than `additional` bytes may be reserved in order to avoid frequent\n/// reallocations. A call to `reserve` may result in an allocation.\n///\n/// Before allocating new buffer space, the function will attempt to reclaim\n/// space in the existing buffer. If the current handle references a view\n/// into a larger original buffer, and all other handles referencing part\n/// of the same original buffer have been dropped, then the current view\n/// can be copied/shifted to the front of the buffer and the handle can take\n/// ownership of the full buffer, provided that the full buffer is large\n/// enough to fit the requested additional capacity.\n///\n/// This optimization will only happen if shifting the data from the current\n/// view to the front of the buffer is not too expensive in terms of the\n/// (amortized) time required. The precise condition is subject to change;\n/// as of now, the length of the data being shifted needs to be at least as\n/// large as the distance that it's shifted by. If the current view is empty\n/// and the original buffer is large enough to fit the requested additional\n/// capacity, then reallocations will never happen.\n///\n/// # Examples\n///\n/// In the following example, a new buffer is allocated.\n///\n/// ```\n/// use bytes::BytesMut;\n///\n/// let mut buf = BytesMut::from(&b\"hello\"[..]);\n/// buf.reserve(64);\n/// assert!(buf.capacity() >= 69);\n/// ```\n///\n/// In the following example, the existing buffer is reclaimed.\n///\n/// ```\n/// use bytes::{BytesMut, BufMut};\n///\n/// let mut buf = BytesMut::with_capacity(128);\n/// buf.put(&[0; 64][..]);\n///\n/// let ptr = buf.as_ptr();\n/// let other = buf.split();\n///\n/// assert!(buf.is_empty());\n/// assert_eq!(buf.capacity(), 64);\n///\n/// drop(other);\n/// buf.reserve(128);\n///\n/// assert_eq!(buf.capacity(), 128);\n/// assert_eq!(buf.as_ptr(), ptr);\n/// ```\n///\n/// # Panics\n///\n/// Panics if the new capacity overflows `usize`.\n",
