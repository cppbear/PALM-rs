  "doc": "/// Create a new PRNG seeded from an infallible `Rng`.\n///\n/// This may be useful when needing to rapidly seed many PRNGs from a master\n/// PRNG, and to allow forking of PRNGs. It may be considered deterministic.\n///\n/// The master PRNG should be at least as high quality as the child PRNGs.\n/// When seeding non-cryptographic child PRNGs, we recommend using a\n/// different algorithm for the master PRNG (ideally a CSPRNG) to avoid\n/// correlations between the child PRNGs. If this is not possible (e.g.\n/// forking using small non-crypto PRNGs) ensure that your PRNG has a good\n/// mixing function on the output or consider use of a hash function with\n/// `from_seed`.\n///\n/// Note that seeding `XorShiftRng` from another `XorShiftRng` provides an\n/// extreme example of what can go wrong: the new PRNG will be a clone\n/// of the parent.\n///\n/// PRNG implementations are allowed to assume that a good RNG is provided\n/// for seeding, and that it is cryptographically secure when appropriate.\n/// As of `rand` 0.7 / `rand_core` 0.5, implementations overriding this\n/// method should ensure the implementation satisfies reproducibility\n/// (in prior versions this was not required).\n///\n/// [`rand`]: https://docs.rs/rand\n",
