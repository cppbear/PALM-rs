For (approximations of) continuous types (e.g. `f32`, `f64`),\n/// samples may equal `high` due to loss of precision but may not be\n/// greater than `high`.\n///\n/// By default this is implemented using\n/// `UniformSampler::new(low, high).sample(rng)`. However, for some types\n/// more optimal implementations for single usage may be provided via this\n/// method (which is the case for integers and floats).\n/// Results may not be identical.\n///\n/// Note that to use this method in a generic context, the type needs to be\n/// retrieved via `SampleUniform::Sampler` as follows:\n/// ```\n/// use rand::distr::uniform::{SampleUniform, UniformSampler};\n/// # #[allow(unused)]\n/// fn sample_from_range<T: SampleUniform>(lb: T, ub: T) -> T {\n///     let mut rng = rand::rng();\n///     <T as SampleUniform>::Sampler::sample_single(lb, ub, &mut rng).unwrap()\n/// }\n/// ```\n",
