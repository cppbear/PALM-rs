Results are returned in an arbitrary order (there is\n/// no guarantee of shuffling or ordering).\n///\n/// Function `weight` is called once for each index to provide weights.\n///\n/// This method is used internally by the slice sampling methods, but it can\n/// sometimes be useful to have the indices themselves so this is provided as\n/// an alternative.\n///\n/// Error cases:\n/// -   [`WeightError::InvalidWeight`] when a weight is not-a-number or negative.\n///\n/// This implementation uses `O(length + amount)` space and `O(length)` time.\n",
