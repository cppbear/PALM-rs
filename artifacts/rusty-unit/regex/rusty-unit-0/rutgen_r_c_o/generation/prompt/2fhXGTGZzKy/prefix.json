  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. Omit test oracles and assertions; concentrate on generating test inputs and function calls of the focal function; do not use \"_\" for the return values of the focal function.\n3. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context.\n5. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides.\n6. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n7. Define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n8. Create a minimal yet comprehensive set of test functions, ensuring each test input satisfies all given constraints, with some explicitly covering edge scenarios.\n9. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",
  "static_pt": "The context for the focal function is as follows:\n// regex-syntax/src/lib.rs\n// crate name is regex_syntax\npub use error::{Error, Result};\npub use parser::{Parser, ParserBuilder};\npub fn escape_into(text: &str, buf: &mut String) {\n    for c in text.chars() {\n        if is_meta_character(c) {\n            buf.push('\\\\');\n        }\n        buf.push(c);\n    }\n}\npub fn is_meta_character(c: char) -> bool {\n    match c {\n        '\\\\' | '.' | '+' | '*' | '?' | '(' | ')' | '|' | '[' | ']' | '{' | '}' | '^'\n        | '$' | '#' | '&' | '-' | '~' => true,\n        _ => false,\n    }\n}\n\nThe function to be tested is presented as follows:\n/// Escapes all meta characters in `text` and writes the result into `buf`.\n///\n/// This will append escape characters into the given buffer.
