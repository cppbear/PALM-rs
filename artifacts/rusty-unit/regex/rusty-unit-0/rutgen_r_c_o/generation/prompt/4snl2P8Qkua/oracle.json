Generate executable test oracle codes in plain text format, one per line. Do not output complete test functions, do not repeat provided test prefixes, avoid additional explanations, and do not use Markdown.\n2. Generate necessary test oracles solely for the provided test prefixes.\n3. Each test oracle's assertions are independent and have no dependencies between them.\n4. Group all non-assertion statements first, followed by all assertion statements.\n5. Generate test oracles by interpreting the behavior of the test function through the provided test prefixes, context, and documentation.\n",

If the AST exceeds the given limit (e.g., with too many nested\n/// groups), then an error is returned by the parser.\n///\n/// The purpose of this limit is to act as a heuristic to prevent stack\n/// overflow for consumers that do structural induction on an `Ast` using\n/// explicit recursion. While this crate never does this (instead using\n/// constant stack space and moving the call stack to the heap), other\n/// crates may.\n///\n/// This limit is not checked until the entire Ast is parsed. Therefore,\n/// if callers want to put a limit on the amount of heap space used, then\n/// they should impose a limit on the length, in bytes, of the concrete\n/// pattern string. In particular, this is viable since this parser\n/// implementation will limit itself to heap space proportional to the\n/// lenth of the pattern string.\n///\n/// Note that a nest limit of `0` will return a nest limit error for most\n/// patterns but not all. For example, a nest limit of `0` permits `a` but\n/// not `ab`, since `ab` requires a concatenation, which results in a nest\n/// depth of `1`. In general, a nest limit is not something that manifests\n/// in an obvious way in the concrete syntax, therefore, it should not be\n/// used in a granular way.\npub fn nest_limit(&mut self, limit: u32) -> &mut ParserBuilder {\n    self.nest_limit = limit;\n    self\n}\n",
