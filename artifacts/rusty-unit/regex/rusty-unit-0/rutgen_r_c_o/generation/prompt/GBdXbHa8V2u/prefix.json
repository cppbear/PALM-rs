  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. Omit test oracles and assertions; concentrate on generating test inputs and function calls of the focal function; do not use \"_\" for the return values of the focal function.\n3. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context.\n5. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides.\n6. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n7. Define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n8. Create a minimal yet comprehensive set of test functions, ensuring each test input satisfies all given constraints, with some explicitly covering edge scenarios.\n9. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",

If the AST exceeds the given limit (e.g., with too many nested\n/// groups), then an error is returned by the parser.\n///\n/// The purpose of this limit is to act as a heuristic to prevent stack\n/// overflow for consumers that do structural induction on an `Ast` using\n/// explicit recursion. While this crate never does this (instead using\n/// constant stack space and moving the call stack to the heap), other\n/// crates may.\n///\n/// This limit is not checked until the entire Ast is parsed. Therefore,\n/// if callers want to put a limit on the amount of heap space used, then\n/// they should impose a limit on the length, in bytes, of the concrete\n/// pattern string. In particular, this is viable since this parser\n/// implementation will limit itself to heap space proportional to the\n/// lenth of the pattern string.\n///\n/// Note that a nest limit of `0` will return a nest limit error for most\n/// patterns but not all. For example, a nest limit of `0` permits `a` but\n/// not `ab`, since `ab` requires a concatenation, which results in a nest\n/// depth of `1`. In general, a nest limit is not something that manifests\n/// in an obvious way in the concrete syntax, therefore, it should not be\n/// used in a granular way.\npub fn nest_limit(&mut self, limit: u32) -> &mut ParserBuilder {\n    self.ast.nest_limit(limit);\n    self\n}\nGiven the following constraints, potential panic-triggering statements, and expected return values/types (all extracted from the function under test).\nGenerate test inputs that maximize the function's runtime satisfaction of all constraints and expected outputs while considering panic conditions:\n",
