Generate executable test oracle codes in plain text format, one per line. Do not output complete test functions, do not repeat provided test prefixes, avoid additional explanations, and do not use Markdown.\n2. Generate necessary test oracles solely for the provided test prefixes.\n3. Each test oracle's assertions are independent and have no dependencies between them.\n4. Group all non-assertion statements first, followed by all assertion statements.\n5. Generate test oracles by interpreting the behavior of the test function through the provided test prefixes, context, and documentation.\n",

For example, `a`, `\\x61`, `\\u0061` and\n/// `\\141` are all equivalent regular expressions, where the last example\n/// shows octal syntax.\n///\n/// While supporting octal syntax isn't in and of itself a problem, it does\n/// make good error messages harder. That is, in PCRE based regex engines,\n/// syntax like `\\0` invokes a backreference, which is explicitly\n/// unsupported in Rust's regex engine. However, many users expect it to\n/// be supported. Therefore, when octal support is disabled, the error\n/// message will explicitly mention that backreferences aren't supported.\n///\n/// Octal syntax is disabled by default.\npub fn octal(&mut self, yes: bool) -> &mut ParserBuilder {\n    self.octal = yes;\n    self\n}\n",
