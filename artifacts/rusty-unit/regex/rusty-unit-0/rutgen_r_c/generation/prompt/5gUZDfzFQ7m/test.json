  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",

For example, `a`, `\\x61`, `\\u0061` and\n/// `\\141` are all equivalent regular expressions, where the last example\n/// shows octal syntax.\n///\n/// While supporting octal syntax isn't in and of itself a problem, it does\n/// make good error messages harder. That is, in PCRE based regex engines,\n/// syntax like `\\0` invokes a backreference, which is explicitly\n/// unsupported in Rust's regex engine. However, many users expect it to\n/// be supported. Therefore, when octal support is disabled, the error\n/// message will explicitly mention that backreferences aren't supported.\n///\n/// Octal syntax is disabled by default.\npub fn octal(&mut self, yes: bool) -> &mut ParserBuilder {\n    self.ast.octal(yes);\n    self\n}\nGiven the following constraints, potential panic-triggering statements, and expected return values/types (all extracted from the function under test).\nGenerate test inputs that maximize the function's runtime satisfaction of all constraints and expected outputs while considering panic conditions:\n",
