  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",
  "static_pt": "// src/raw/mod.rs\n// crate name is hashbrown\nThe function to be tested is presented as follows:\n/// Searches for an element in the table, or a potential slot where that element could\n/// be inserted (an empty or deleted [`Bucket`] index).\n///\n/// This uses dynamic dispatch to reduce the amount of code generated, but that is\n/// eliminated by LLVM optimizations.\n///\n/// This function does not make any changes to the `data` part of the table, or any\n/// changes to the `items` or `growth_left` field of the table.\n///\n/// The table must have at least 1 empty or deleted `bucket`, otherwise, if the\n/// `eq: &mut dyn FnMut(usize) -> bool` function does not return `true`, this function\n/// will never return (will go into an infinite loop) for tables larger than the group\n/// width, or return an index outside of the table indices range if the table is less\n/// than the group width.\n///\n/// This function is guaranteed to provide the `eq: &mut dyn FnMut(usize) -> bool`\n/// function with only `FULL` buckets' indices and return the `index` of the found\n/// element (as `Ok(index)`). If the element is not found and there is at least 1\n/// empty or deleted [`Bucket`] in the table, the function is guaranteed to return\n/// [`InsertSlot`] with an index in the range `0..self.buckets()`, but in any case,\n/// if this function returns [`InsertSlot`], it will contain an index in the range\n/// `0..=self.buckets()`.\n///\n/// # Safety\n///\n/// The [`RawTableInner`] must have properly initialized control bytes otherwise calling\n/// this function results in [`undefined behavior`].\n///\n/// Attempt to write data at the [`InsertSlot`] returned by this function when the table is\n/// less than the group width and if there was not at least one empty or deleted bucket in\n/// the table will cause immediate [`undefined behavior`]. This is because in this case the\n/// function will return `self.bucket_mask + 1` as an index due to the trailing [`Tag::EMPTY`]\n/// control bytes outside the table range.\n///\n/// [`undefined behavior`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html\nunsafe fn find_or_find_insert_slot_inner(\n    &self,\n    hash: u64,\n    eq: &mut dyn FnMut(usize) -> bool,\n) -> Result<usize, InsertSlot> {\n    let mut insert_slot = None;\n\n    let tag_hash = Tag::full(hash);\n    let mut probe_seq = self.probe_seq(hash);\n\n    loop {\n        // SAFETY:\n        // * Caller of this function ensures that the control bytes are properly initialized.\n        //\n        // * `ProbeSeq.pos` cannot be greater than `self.bucket_mask = self.buckets() - 1`\n        //   of the table due to masking with `self.bucket_mask` and also because the number\n        //   of buckets is a power of two (see `self.probe_seq` function).\n        //\n        // * Even if `ProbeSeq.pos` returns `position == self.bucket_mask`, it is safe to\n        //   call `Group::load` due to the extended control bytes range, which is\n        //  `self.bucket_mask + 1 + Group::WIDTH` (in fact, this means that the last control\n        //   byte will never be read for the allocated table);\n        //\n        // * Also, even if `RawTableInner` is not already allocated, `ProbeSeq.pos` will\n        //   always return \"0\" (zero), so Group::load will read unaligned `Group::static_empty()`\n        //   bytes, which is safe (see RawTableInner::new).\n        let group = unsafe { Group::load(self.ctrl(probe_seq.pos)) };\n\n        for bit in group.match_tag(tag_hash) {\n            let index = (probe_seq.pos + bit) & self.bucket_mask;\n\n            if likely(eq(index)) {\n                return Ok(index);\n            }\n        }\n\n        // We didn't find the element we were looking for in the group, try to get an\n        // insertion slot from the group if we don't have one yet.\n        if likely(insert_slot.is_none()) {\n            insert_slot = self.find_insert_slot_in_group(&group, &probe_seq);\n        }\n\n        // Only stop the search if the group contains at least one empty element.\n        // Otherwise, the element that we are looking for might be in a following group.\n        if likely(group.match_empty().any_bit_set()) {\n            // We must have found a insert slot by now, since the current group contains at\n            // least one.
