  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",
  "static_pt": "// src/raw/mod.rs\n// crate name is hashbrown\nThe function to be tested is presented as follows:\n/// Erases the [`Bucket`]'s control byte at the given index so that it does not\n/// triggered as full, decreases the `items` of the table and, if it can be done,\n/// increases `self.growth_left`.\n///\n/// This function does not actually erase / drop the [`Bucket`] itself, i.e. it\n/// does not make any changes to the `data` parts of the table. The caller of this\n/// function must take care to properly drop the `data`, otherwise calling this\n/// function may result in a memory leak.\n///\n/// # Safety\n///\n/// You must observe the following safety rules when calling this function:\n///\n/// * The [`RawTableInner`] has already been allocated;\n///\n/// * It must be the full control byte at the given position;\n///\n/// * The `index` must not be greater than the `RawTableInner.bucket_mask`, i.e.\n///   `index <= RawTableInner.bucket_mask` or, in other words, `(index + 1)` must\n///   be no greater than the number returned by the function [`RawTableInner::buckets`].\n///\n/// Calling this function on a table that has not been allocated results in [`undefined behavior`].\n///\n/// Calling this function on a table with no elements is unspecified, but calling subsequent\n/// functions is likely to result in [`undefined behavior`] due to overflow subtraction\n/// (`self.items -= 1 cause overflow when self.items == 0`).\n///\n/// See also [`Bucket::as_ptr`] method, for more information about of properly removing\n/// or saving `data element` from / into the [`RawTable`] / [`RawTableInner`].\n///\n/// [`RawTableInner::buckets`]: RawTableInner::buckets\n/// [`Bucket::as_ptr`]: Bucket::as_ptr\n/// [`undefined behavior`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html\nunsafe fn erase(&mut self, index: usize) {\n    debug_assert!(self.is_bucket_full(index));\n\n    // This is the same as `index.wrapping_sub(Group::WIDTH) % self.buckets()` because\n    // the number of buckets is a power of two, and `self.bucket_mask = self.buckets() - 1`.\n    let index_before = index.wrapping_sub(Group::WIDTH) & self.bucket_mask;\n    // SAFETY:\n    // - The caller must uphold the safety contract for `erase` method;\n    // - `index_before` is guaranteed to be in range due to masking with `self.bucket_mask`\n    let empty_before = Group::load(self.ctrl(index_before)).match_empty();\n    let empty_after = Group::load(self.ctrl(index)).match_empty();\n\n    // Inserting and searching in the map is performed by two key functions:\n    //\n    // - The `find_insert_slot` function that looks up the index of any `Tag::EMPTY` or `Tag::DELETED`\n    //   slot in a group to be able to insert. If it doesn't find an `Tag::EMPTY` or `Tag::DELETED`\n    //   slot immediately in the first group, it jumps to the next `Group` looking for it,\n    //   and so on until it has gone through all the groups in the control bytes.\n    //\n    // - The `find_inner` function that looks for the index of the desired element by looking\n    //   at all the `FULL` bytes in the group. If it did not find the element right away, and\n    //   there is no `Tag::EMPTY` byte in the group, then this means that the `find_insert_slot`\n    //   function may have found a suitable slot in the next group. Therefore, `find_inner`\n    //   jumps further, and if it does not find the desired element and again there is no `Tag::EMPTY`\n    //   byte, then it jumps further, and so on. The search stops only if `find_inner` function\n    //   finds the desired element or hits an `Tag::EMPTY` slot/byte.\n    //\n    // Accordingly, this leads to two consequences:\n    //\n    // - The map must have `Tag::EMPTY` slots (bytes);\n    //\n    // - You can't just mark the byte to be erased as `Tag::EMPTY`, because otherwise the `find_inner`\n    //   function may stumble upon an `Tag::EMPTY` byte before finding the desired element and stop\n    //   searching.\n    //\n    // Thus it is necessary to check all bytes after and before the erased element. If we are in\n    // a contiguous `Group` of `FULL` or `Tag::DELETED` bytes (the number of `FULL` or `Tag::DELETED` bytes\n    // before and after is greater than or equal to `Group::WIDTH`), then we must mark our byte as\n    // `Tag::DELETED` in order for the `find_inner` function to go further. On the other hand, if there\n    // is at least one `Tag::EMPTY` slot in the `Group`, then the `find_inner` function will still stumble\n    // upon an `Tag::EMPTY` byte, so we can safely mark our erased byte as `Tag::EMPTY` as well.\n    //\n    // Finally, since `index_before == (index.wrapping_sub(Group::WIDTH) & self.bucket_mask) == index`\n    // and given all of the above, tables smaller than the group width (self.buckets() < Group::WIDTH)\n    // cannot have `Tag::DELETED` bytes.\n    //\n    // Note that in this context `leading_zeros` refers to the bytes at the end of a group, while\n    // `trailing_zeros` refers to the bytes at the beginning of a group.\n    let ctrl = if empty_before.leading_zeros() + empty_after.trailing_zeros() >= Group::WIDTH {\n        Tag::DELETED\n    } else {\n        self.growth_left += 1;\n        Tag::EMPTY\n    };\n    // SAFETY: the caller must uphold the safety contract for `erase` method.\n    self.set_ctrl(index, ctrl);\n    self.items -= 1;\n}\n",
