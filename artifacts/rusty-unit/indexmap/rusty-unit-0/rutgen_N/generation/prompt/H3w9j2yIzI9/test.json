  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",

Otherwise, it inserts the\n/// new item and returns its sorted index and `true`.\n///\n/// If the existing items are **not** already sorted, then the insertion\n/// index is unspecified (like [`slice::binary_search`]), but the value\n/// is moved to or inserted at that position regardless.\n///\n/// Computes in **O(n)** time (average). Instead of repeating calls to\n/// `insert_sorted`, it may be faster to call batched [`insert`][Self::insert]\n/// or [`extend`][Self::extend] and only call [`sort`][Self::sort] or\n/// [`sort_unstable`][Self::sort_unstable] once.\npub fn insert_sorted(&mut self, value: T) -> (usize, bool)\nwhere\n    T: Ord,\n{\n    let (index, existing) = self.map.insert_sorted(value, ());\n    (index, existing.is_none())\n}\n",
