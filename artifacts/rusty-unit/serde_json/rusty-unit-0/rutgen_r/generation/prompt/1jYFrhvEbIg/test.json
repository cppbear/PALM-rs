  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",
  "static_pt": "// src/value/mod.rs\n// crate name is serde_json\nThe function to be tested is presented as follows:\n/// Mutably index into a JSON array or map. A string index can be used to\n/// access a value in a map, and a usize index can be used to access an\n/// element of an array.\n///\n/// Returns `None` if the type of `self` does not match the type of the\n/// index, for example if the index is a string and `self` is an array or a\n/// number. Also returns `None` if the given key does not exist in the map\n/// or the given index is not within the bounds of the array.\n///\n/// ```\n/// # use serde_json::json;\n/// #\n/// let mut object = json!({ \"A\": 65, \"B\": 66, \"C\": 67 });\n/// *object.get_mut(\"A\").unwrap() = json!(69);\n///\n/// let mut array = json!([ \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" ]);\n/// *array.get_mut(2).unwrap() = json!(\"D\");\n/// ```\npub fn get_mut<I: Index>(&mut self, index: I) -> Option<&mut Value> {\n    index.index_into_mut(self)\n}\nGiven the following constraints, potential panic-triggering statements, and expected return values/types (all extracted from the function under test).\nGenerate test inputs that maximize the function's runtime satisfaction of all constraints and expected outputs while considering panic conditions:\n",
