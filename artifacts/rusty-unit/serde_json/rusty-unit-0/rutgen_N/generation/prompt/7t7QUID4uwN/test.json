  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",
  "static_pt": "// src/map.rs\n// crate name is serde_json\nThe function to be tested is presented as follows:\n/// Sorts this map's entries in-place using `str`'s usual ordering.\n///\n/// If serde_json's \"preserve_order\" feature is not enabled, this method\n/// does no work because all JSON maps are always kept in a sorted state.\n///\n/// If serde_json's \"preserve_order\" feature is enabled, this method\n/// destroys the original source order or insertion order of this map in\n/// favor of an alphanumerical order that matches how a BTreeMap with the\n/// same contents would be ordered. This takes **O(n log n + c)** time where\n/// _n_ is the length of the map and _c_ is the capacity.\n///\n/// Other maps nested within the values of this map are not sorted. If you\n/// need the entire data structure to be sorted at all levels, you must also\n/// call\n/// <code>map.[values_mut]\\().for_each([Value::sort_all_objects])</code>.\n///\n/// [values_mut]: Map::values_mut\npub fn sort_keys(&mut self) {\n    #[cfg(feature = \"preserve_order\")]\n    self.map.sort_unstable_keys();\n}\n",
