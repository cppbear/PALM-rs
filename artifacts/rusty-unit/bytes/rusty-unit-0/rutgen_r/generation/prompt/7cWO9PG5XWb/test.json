  "system_pt": "As a software testing expert, please generate Rust test functions based on the following guidelines:\n1. Provide the code in plain text format, without explanations or Markdown.\n2. If the method under test belongs to a trait, construct appropriate structs within the test function, but avoid method overrides. If the method under test uses generics, instantiate them with suitable types based on the context.\n3. Generate test code with minimal scope: avoid creating external structures or implementations. Instead, define any necessary helper structures or implementations directly within the test function when required.\n4. Whenever possible, initialize the corresponding data structures using the initialization methods provided in the context if exist.\n5. Ensure the generated function is fully implemented and can be compiled and executed directly without any missing parts.\n6. Create a minimal yet complete set of test functions, ensuring they adhere to all provided preconditions and cover boundary conditions.\n7. Do not create a test module, but include intrinsic attributes like #[test] or #[should_panic] where necessary.\n",
  "static_pt": "// src/bytes_mut.rs\n// crate name is bytes\nThe function to be tested is presented as follows:\n/// Reserves capacity for at least `additional` more bytes to be inserted\n/// into the given `BytesMut`.\n///\n/// More than `additional` bytes may be reserved in order to avoid frequent\n/// reallocations. A call to `reserve` may result in an allocation.\n///\n/// Before allocating new buffer space, the function will attempt to reclaim\n/// space in the existing buffer. If the current handle references a view\n/// into a larger original buffer, and all other handles referencing part\n/// of the same original buffer have been dropped, then the current view\n/// can be copied/shifted to the front of the buffer and the handle can take\n/// ownership of the full buffer, provided that the full buffer is large\n/// enough to fit the requested additional capacity.\n///\n/// This optimization will only happen if shifting the data from the current\n/// view to the front of the buffer is not too expensive in terms of the\n/// (amortized) time required. The precise condition is subject to change;\n/// as of now, the length of the data being shifted needs to be at least as\n/// large as the distance that it's shifted by. If the current view is empty\n/// and the original buffer is large enough to fit the requested additional\n/// capacity, then reallocations will never happen.\n///\n/// # Examples\n///\n/// In the following example, a new buffer is allocated.\n///\n/// ```\n/// use bytes::BytesMut;\n///\n/// let mut buf = BytesMut::from(&b\"hello\"[..]);\n/// buf.reserve(64);\n/// assert!(buf.capacity() >= 69);\n/// ```\n///\n/// In the following example, the existing buffer is reclaimed.\n///\n/// ```\n/// use bytes::{BytesMut, BufMut};\n///\n/// let mut buf = BytesMut::with_capacity(128);\n/// buf.put(&[0; 64][..]);\n///\n/// let ptr = buf.as_ptr();\n/// let other = buf.split();\n///\n/// assert!(buf.is_empty());\n/// assert_eq!(buf.capacity(), 64);\n///\n/// drop(other);\n/// buf.reserve(128);\n///\n/// assert_eq!(buf.capacity(), 128);\n/// assert_eq!(buf.as_ptr(), ptr);\n/// ```\n///\n/// # Panics\n///\n/// Panics if the new capacity overflows `usize`.\npub fn reserve(&mut self, additional: usize) {\n    let len = self.len();\n    let rem = self.capacity() - len;\n\n    if additional <= rem {\n        // The handle can already store at least `additional` more bytes, so\n        // there is no further work needed to be done.\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // will always succeed\n    let _ = self.reserve_inner(additional, true);\n}\nGiven the following constraints, potential panic-triggering statements, and expected return values/types (all extracted from the function under test).\nGenerate test inputs that maximize the function's runtime satisfaction of all constraints and expected outputs while considering panic conditions:\n",
